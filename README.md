# Sisif-Bot
Sisif-Bot is a Discord bot I made for my colleagues. 

Each command is prefixed with a dot.


     Commands for developer:

     .stapan - shows the text: „Tu ești stăpânul meu”. ("You are my master").


    Technical/administrative commands (admins and group leaders):

     .ping - shows ping.
     .info @member_name - shows the date at which the member had joined the server and the number of roles he has.
     .kick @member_name reason (optional) - kicks the member.
     .ban @member_name reason (optional) - bans the member.
     .unban @memeber_name - unbans the member.


    Usual commands (each role beside Outsider):

     .student family_name / full_name - search in a database the full name of the student (if exists) and shows it, along with the group.
     .facebook / .fb - shows the link from the facebook group.
     .drives info/ipc/fc - shows the link for each of the drives (info, ipc, fc).
     .incoming / .teste / .examene - shows the timetable for each exam.
     .sef - shows the name of our leader.
     .lider 1/2/3 - shows the name of the first, second or third group's leader.
     .link subject - shows the Zoom link for the subject.
     .report @nume_membru reason~evidence   - reports the member with the username member_name. Both the reason and the evidence can contain spaces between them. The information is send to a private, admins-only channel. I advise you to respect the sintax. Don't forget the character `~` between the reason and the evidence, to help Sisif split them properly.
